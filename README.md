## Projects

**[Artificial Intelligence-Genetic Algorithms on Objects](https://github.com/RoninSanta/Artificial_Intelligence-Genetic_Algorithms_on_Objects)**

I hope to test the effects of evolutionary genetic algorithm and create an object that can learn to walk without any user interference in the whole process. The Python script I created is capable of improving its capabilities by itself, slowly correcting itself after each generation and slowly gets better at walking/ moving similar to how animals evolve in nature.

**[Machine Learning-Classical JAP Literature Text Recognition](https://github.com/RoninSanta/Machine_Learning-Classical_JAP_Literature_Text_Recognition)**

Kuzushiji, a ancient form of cursive writing that is used for centuries prior to 19th century Japan. Majority of historical documents that exist in the archives of Japan are written in this form of writing. Therefore, it would be great to have a model that could transcribe ancient Kuzushiji scripts into modern characters for researchers to understand what is recorded.

**[SGBusInfo APP](https://github.com/RoninSanta/Mobile_App_Dev_API-SGBusInfoAPP)**

A mobile app I created that aims to show Bus Stops and associated Bus Information in Singapore, the data is being constantly updated in real-time. It is meant to be a light-weight version of popular apps on the market currently such as MyTransportSG and SG BusLeh.

**[Camer Surveillance System APP](https://github.com/RoninSanta/CM3070-Camera-Surveillance-System-Project)**

A app project created using \*_Python_, it makes use of machine learning to detect motion in the camera footage, track its
movement and recognize objects in the moving footage. This possess a wide range of application uses, from day-to-day commercial use to surveillance system of entire companies. It is light-weight in nature and uses significantly less processing power as compared to available devices in the market.

**[Mario Game Clone](https://github.com/RoninSanta/Game_Project-Mario_Clone)**

This is my attempt in recreating a platforming game similar to 'Mario' with \*_JavaScript_ library. It controls with similar movement as an actual platforming game with game mechanics such as player gravity, Death/Game Over scene and not to mention Lives system and Coins collection incentive for the player to continue playing.
